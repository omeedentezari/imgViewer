# Image Viewer
A very basic image viewer web component.  

# How to use
1.  Add `imgViewer.css` and `imgViewer.js` to your html file.
2.  Create thumbnail tags by adding the `data-imgviewer-thumbnail` to any html tag that should be an image.
3.  For each thumbnail tag, dd a `data-img-loc` attribute that equals the path to the image relative to the html file.
4.  (Optional) For each thumbnail tag, add a `data-img-title` that equals the value of the hover text shown.
